## Overview
### Description
An app that allows users to add members to a group, create shared grocery lists, and share recipes. Would prevent families or roommates from buying the same groceries or forgetting groceries.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Personal/Social Media
- **Mobile:** This app is intended entirely for mobile since people would not be bringing laptops or desktop computers with them to go grocery shopping.
- **Story:** Allows families, roommates, or any group of people to share a grocery list, allowing all members of the group to add to the list as well as know what needs to still be picked up. Also allows users to connect by sharing recipes.
- **Market:** Families, groups of roomates / friends, people who enjoy cooking. The primary age group is college aged students with roommates, but people of all ages could use the app.
- **Habit:** Multiple times per day when adding items, 1-2 times per week when going shopping
- **Scope:** We will begin by using the Walmart API to possibly show pictures of the items on the grocery list, but it could possibly evolve to include several different types of grocery stores or even youtube for how-to videos for the recipes shared on the app.
